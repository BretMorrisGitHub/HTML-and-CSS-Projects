# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is where I store my HTML and CSS Projects.


Space Station Website:
This website is an example of a space travel companies website. It is styled using CSS, and contains multiple elements, including a nav bar, gallery, and a contact area
using form tags.

Movie Theater Website w/ Bootstrap:
This website is an example of writing a website having the help with Bootstrap, to obtain pre built code for whatever you would like.

Portfolio Website:
This website I wrote using HTML, and styled with CSS. I wrote it for other people to view my work, and to get a better understanding of me, my background, and 
experience.
