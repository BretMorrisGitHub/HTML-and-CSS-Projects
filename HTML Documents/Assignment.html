	<p> Here is a quote about Corgi's from Wikipedia.</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Corgi">
	The Welsh Corgi (/ˈkɔːrɡi/[5] or Corgi, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically consistent 
	Corgwn; /ˈkɔːrɡuːn/) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is derived from 
	the Welsh words cor and ci (which is mutated to gi), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively.
